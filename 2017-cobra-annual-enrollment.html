                <h3>New medical insurance carrier: UnitedHealthcare </h3>
                <p>Beginning January 1, 2017, UnitedHealthcare (UHC) will replace Blue Shield of California as the national insurance carrier for the Preferred Provider Organization plan with $300 deductible (now called the $300 Deductible plan) and the Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with HSA medical plan options.
                
                <h3>New medical carrier but the same $300 Deductible Plan and Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP)</h3>
                <p>The $300 Deductible and CDHP with HSA medical plans will work the same way under UHC as they currently do under Blue Shield of California—same deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket maximums, etc. (You may notice that the PPO 300 medical plan option will now be called the $300 Deductible plan to better reflect the differences between it and the Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with HSA medical plan.)</p>
                <h3>UnitedHealthcare providers</h3>
                <p>Because there is significant overlap between the UHC and Blue Shield of California provider networks, most participants will be able to continue seeing their current in-network doctors. (As it was with Blue Shield, you still have your choice of providers, but you will pay significantly less by using in-network providers.) Check to see if your physicians are part of the UHC network. Visit <a href="http://welcometouhc.com/paypal" target="blank">http://welcometouhc.com/paypal</a> to do a provider search. </p>
                
                <h3>Transition of Care</h3>
                <p>If you or a covered family member is in a current course of treatment with a provider who is not in the UnitedHealthcare network, you may be eligible for transition of care services, which enable you to continue with your non-network provider for a limited time.  Examples of situations that would be considered for transition of care are: a surgery scheduled for January 2017 at a non-UHC network facility or with a non-UHC network provider; the last trimester of pregnancy with a non-UHC network physician; an ongoing treatment for a significant health condition with non-UHC network providers.  </p>
                <p>Please contact UHC at <strong>844-298-2737</strong> to discuss Transition of Care. The UHC team will assist you and/or your family member and guide you on the best way to ensure continuity of treatment and care, including how to request Transition of Care. UHC may approve continued treatment by the current doctor for a limited time if UHC determines it is medically necessary that you continue treatment with your current physician. Please visit the "Transition of Care" section of <a href="http://welcometouhc.com/paypal" class="display-together">http://welcometouhc.com/paypal.</a> </p>
                
                <h3>PPO 750 plan</h3>
                <p>The PPO 750 plan will no longer be offered beginning January 1, 2017. If you’re currently enrolled in the PPO 750 plan, you’ll automatically transition to the $300 Deductible plan unless you make another selection.  If you’re comfortable moving to the $300 Deductible plan, you don’t need to do anything. You may also choose a regional HMO, if available to you. </p>

                <h3 id="prescriptionenhancements">Prescription enhancements: More flexibility for getting maintenance medications </h3>
                <p>Do you take maintenance medications on an ongoing basis (for example, to help control high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma)? If so, you can already get a 90-day supply at a reduced cost by using the mail-order option. Beginning January 1, 2017, you can also choose to pick up a 90-day supply of maintenance drugs at your local CVS/caremark or Target retail pharmacy. The price is the same as mail order: a 90-day supply for the cost of a 60-day supply (it's like getting a month's supply for free).</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.brainshark.com/cvscaremark/vu?pi=zHZzjTPIlzGbUKz0" target="blank"> Watch a video</a> about your options for getting maintenance medications. </p>
               <h3>If you don't take any action during Annual Enrollment, here’s what will happen:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you’re currently enrolled in the PPO 750, you’ll automatically be enrolled in the $300 Deductible plan with UnitedHealthcare, covering the same dependents you currently cover. </li>
                  <li>If you’re currently enrolled in the PPO 300 or CDHP with HSA, you’ll automatically be enrolled in the same plan ($300 Deductible or CDHP with HSA) with UnitedHealthcare, covering the same dependents you currently cover. </li>
                  <li>If you’re currently enrolled in one of the HMO plans, your election will not change.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>New ID cards for UnitedHealthcare</h3>
                <p>Expect to receive a new medical plan ID card with a new member ID and a new group number (Group # 909006) from UHC in December. After December 15, additional cards can be requested on <strong>myuhc.com</strong> or from UHC Customer Service by calling <strong>844-298-2737</strong>. </p>
