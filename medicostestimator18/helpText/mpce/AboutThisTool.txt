The Medical Plan Cost Estimator is designed to give you a general idea of what your annual costs might be under each of the plan options based on:
<ul><li>The services you think you and other covered family members will use during the year.</li><li>The estimated annual cost of care in the geographic area you select, using provider rates for in-network care costs.</li></ul><br><b>Important legal information</b><br>This tool is a financial comparison tool that allows you to estimate relative annual costs across your health coverage options. Estimates are based on regional average medical cost data and most of the specific provisions of PayPal Inc.'s health coverage options. Because costs vary by provider and not all option details are included, actual costs will vary from the costs the Health Plan Cost Comparison Estimator provides. Actual costs may also vary based on the order in which they are incurred and by the specific family member using a service (if applicable).
