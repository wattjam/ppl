          <h1>What's New for 2017</h1>
          <p>PayPal supports you in achieving a happy and healthy life. More choice. More enhancements. More focus on you! An important part of being and staying well is understanding the health plans and well-being benefit resources available to you. Annual Enrollment is the time for you to make the changes that meet your needs.</p>
          <p>There are several important changes and enhancements to your PayPal benefits for next year. The changes are detailed in this website. You will make your enrollment elections on <strong>Your Benefits Resources<sup>TM</sup></strong> (YBR). You can go directly from this website to YBR without needing a password when you are logged into PayPal's network. If you are not logged into PayPal's network, you will need a login and password to access YBR.</p>

                  <h3>New medical insurance carrier: UnitedHealthcare </h3>
                  <p>Beginning January 1, 2017, UnitedHealthcare (UHC) will replace Blue Shield of California as the national insurance carrier for the $300 Deductible and the Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with HSA medical plan options. With this change, PayPal employees can expect improved claims processing, increased support in managing health conditions, and easier access to claims data.</p>
                  
                  <h3>New medical carrier but the same $300 Deductible Plan and Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP)</h3>
                  <p>The $300 Deductible and CDHP with HSA medical plans will work the same way under UHC as they currently do under Blue Shield of California&mdash;same deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket maximums, etc. (You may notice that the PPO 300 medical plan option will now be called the $300 Deductible plan to better reflect the differences between it and the Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) with HSA medical plan.)</p>
                  <h3>UnitedHealthcare providers</h3>
                  <p>Because there is significant overlap between the UHC and Blue Shield of California provider networks, most employees will be able to continue seeing their current in-network doctors. (As it was with Blue Shield, you still have your choice of providers, but you will pay significantly less by using in-network providers.) Check to see if your physicians are part of the UHC network. Visit <a href="http://welcometouhc.com/paypal">http://welcometouhc.com/paypal</a> to do a provider search. </p>
                  
                  <h3>Transition of Care</h3>
                  <p>If you or a covered family member is in a current course of treatment with a provider who is not in the UnitedHealthcare network, you may be eligible for transition of care services, which enable you to continue with your non-network provider for a limited time.  Examples of situations that would be considered for transition of care are: a surgery scheduled for January 2017 at a non-UHC network facility or with a non-UHC network provider; the last trimester of pregnancy with a non-UHC network physician; an ongoing treatment for a significant health condition with non-UHC network providers. </p>
                  <p>Please contact UHC at <strong>844-298-2737</strong> to discuss Transition of Care. The UHC team will assist you and/or your family member and guide you on the best way to ensure continuity of treatment and care, including how to request Transition of Care. UHC may approve continued treatment by the current doctor for a limited time if UHC determines it is medically necessary that you continue treatment with your current physician. Please visit the "Transition of Care" section of <a href="http://paypal.welcometouhc.com/">http://welcometouhc.com/paypal</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h3>PPO 750 plan</h3>
                  <p>As we announced last year, the PPO 750 plan will no longer be offered beginning January 1, 2017 (no new enrollments were accepted in 2016). If you're currently enrolled in the PPO 750 plan, you'll automatically transition to the $300 Deductible plan unless you make another selection.  If you're comfortable moving to the $300 Deductible plan, you don't need to do anything.  If you would like to compare the benefits and cost of the $300 Deductible plan and the CDHP with HSA plan, check out the <a href="pdf/PayPal_2017_Med_Chart.pdf">medical plan comparison chart</a> and the 2017 <a href="medicostestimator17/index.htm" target="blank">Medical Plan Cost Estimator</a>.</p>
                  <p>Employees in Arizona, California and Utah can also choose from their regional HMO plan.</p>

                  <h3 id="prescriptionenhancements">Prescription enhancements: More flexibility for getting maintenance medications </h3>
                  <p>Do you take maintenance medications on an ongoing basis? If so, you can already get a 90-day supply at a reduced cost by using the mail-order option. Beginning January 1, 2017, you can also choose to pick up a 90-day supply of maintenance drugs at your local CVS/caremark or Target retail pharmacy. The price is the same as mail order: a 90-day supply for the price of a 60-day supply (it's like getting a month's supply for free).</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.brainshark.com/cvscaremark/vu?pi=zHZzjTPIlzGbUKz0" target="blank"> Watch a video</a> about your options for getting maintenance medications. </p>
                  <h3>Employee contributions</h3>
                  <p>There are no changes to the <a href="2017-employee-contributions.html">2017 employee contributions</a> for the $300 Deductible, CDHP with HSA or HMO medical plans&mdash;they'll be the same as they were in 2016! If you're currently enrolled in the PPO 750, your cost for coverage for 2017 may be higher or lower, depending on which new medical plan you choose.</p>
                  
                  <h3>If you don't take any action during Annual Enrollment, here's what will happen:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If you're currently enrolled in the PPO 750, you'll automatically be enrolled in the $300 Deductible plan with UnitedHealthcare, covering the same dependents you currently cover.</li>
                    <li>If you're currently enrolled in the PPO 300 or CDHP with HSA, you'll  automatically be enrolled in the same plan ($300 Deductible or CDHP with HSA) with UnitedHealthcare, covering the same dependents you currently cover.</li>
                    <li>If you're currently enrolled in one of the HMO plans, your election will not change.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>New ID cards for UnitedHealthcare</h3>
                  <p>Expect to receive a new medical plan ID card with a new member ID number (assigned by UHC) and a new group number (Group # 909006) in mid-December. After December 15, 2016, additional cards can be requested on <strong>myuhc.com</strong> or from UHC Customer Service by calling <strong>844-298-2737</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <h3>UHC's Virtual Visits will replace Teladoc</h3>
                  <p>UHC's Virtual Visits will replace Teladoc (formerly available under Blue Shield of California). Virtual Visits allow you to connect with a doctor for non-emergency care anytime day or night right from your mobile device or computer without an appointment. You can even get a prescription sent to your local pharmacy. It's fast to get the care or advice you need, easy to use, and available 24/7. The cost of a Virtual Visit is typically lower than being treated at a doctor's office, urgent care center or emergency room.</p>

                  <h3>New HSA banking partner</h3>
                  <p>If you enroll in the CDHP with HSA medical plan, you'll have a new banking partner for your Health Savings Account beginning in January 2017. As part of the transition to UnitedHealthcare, the HSA will now be offered through UHC's banking partner, Optum Bank, which specializes in servicing the health care industry. <strong>This is an administrative change; the HSA will work the same as it does now.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>If you currently have an HSA with Health Equity,</strong> you'll receive information in mid-December about activating your account with Optum Bank, transferring your account balance, and receiving your new Optum Bank HSA debit card. If you choose to keep your account open at Health Equity, you'll be required to begin paying the monthly administrative fee starting in January 2017.</p>
                  <p><strong>If you enroll in the CDHP with HSA for the first time,</strong> you'll receive information in mid-December about how to open your Optum Bank HSA, receive your HSA debit card, and use your account. </p>

                  <p>Please note: For Option 1, the new $300 allowance is shared between frames and lenses, so you could spend $300 on frames, or $300 on lenses, or $150 on each. You have a $150 allowance to spend on a first pair of frames or lenses, and then another $150 to spend on a second pair of frames or lenses. The maximum allowance is $300.</p>

                  <p>We know your family is your Number 1 priority. Our new care programs provided by Bright Horizons can help with short-term or long-term needs. These new programs provide the peace of mind that comes from knowing your loved ones will have the care they need&mdash;when you most need it to be there. </p>
                  <p>Whether it's child day care, adult/elder care, an occasional sitter, or even someone to walk the dog, in 2017 you'll have two new services available through Bright Horizons. </p>
                  <h3>For short-term or last-minute needs:</h3>
                  <p>Rely on full-service, subsidized back-up care for temporary child and adult/elder care when you need to be at work. Care is available for your dependent children and immediate family and your spouse's or domestic partner's immediate family. You'll be able to use back-up care up to 10 times per calendar year (each dependent requiring care counts as one use), whether the care is provided in your home or at an approved local center. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>For in-home care,</strong> you pay $6 per hour for both child and adult/elder care (Four hour minimum). </li>
                    <li><strong>For center-based care,</strong> you pay $15 per day for one child ($25 for two or more).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>For long-term or ongoing needs:</h3>
                  <p>Use Bright Horizons' resources and discounts to provide care for your whole family, including nannies, sitters for elder care, pet sitters, housekeepers and homework help.</p>
                  <p>Discounts and preferred enrollment access for regular center-based child care are also available. <a href="pdf/PayPal_LaunchingOn_FactSheet.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>
                  <h3>Important</h3>
                  <p>Under the Internal Revenue Code, the value of these benefits must be reported as imputed income to you and will be reflected in your paycheck.  Please see the table below for the amount that will be reported as imputed income to you for each use or occurrence.</p>

                  <h2>Rethink: Helping children with learning disabilities</h2>
                  <p>Rethink's award-winning, research-based program provides<strong> support at NO COST to parents raising children with learning or behavior challenges or developmental disabilities.</strong></p>
                  <p>Parents can take advantage of live teleconsultation with behavioral health experts to answer questions and provide guidance as they support their children in reaching their top potential. Teleconsultations can take place over the phone or via video chat, day or night, weekday or weekend. Common teleconsultation topics include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Teaching new skills</li>
                    <li>Addressing problem behaviors at home</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting lack of progress</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with school and other providers</li>
                    <li>Coping with the stress of a new diagnosis or ongoing daily struggles at home</li>
                    <li>Getting the most out of the Rethink platform </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Rethink provides parents with a variety of <strong>resources, training, and support</strong> in a simple web-based format. Parents have access to <strong>printable materials</strong> such as flashcards, worksheets, schedule templates, and token boards. They can watch hundreds of <strong>easy-to-follow videos</strong> from an expansive library depicting behavioral health experts teaching children skills such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Language&mdash;from beginning speech to back-and-forth conversation</li>
                    <li>Socialization&mdash;from making eye contact and basic sharing to telling jokes and working in groups</li>
                    <li>Self-help&mdash;from using utensils and dressing to brushing teeth, hygiene and doing laundry</li>
                    <li>Academics&mdash;from matching and following directions to answering reading comprehension and math word problems</li>
                    <li>Vocational&mdash;from writing an email to filling out a job application</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>Paying for child/elder care? Don't forget the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account</h2>
                  <p>The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) helps you save money on eligible dependent care expenses. You essentially "bank" your pre-tax contributions in a tax-free account that you can use to pay for expenses. You don't pay federal or state income taxes on FSA contributions. </p>
